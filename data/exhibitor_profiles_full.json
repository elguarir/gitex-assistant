    "description": "Chekkit addresses the pervasive issue of counterfeit food and drugs, a $300B or 40% market share loss that gravely impacts communities in Africa and the Middle East. Over 500,000 people die annually from consuming fake or substandard products, according to WHO, because traceability adoption was elusive, causing a lack of transparency in supply chains. Fueled by weak, inconsistent regulatory oversight, corruption, and poor infrastructure. Manufacturers and importers in Africa struggle with ineffective monitoring systems, allowing dangerous counterfeit goods to flood markets. \n\nChekkit uses cryptographic unique identifiers on farm inputs, CPGs, pharmaceuticals, and other physical products, along with our proprietary automated AI workflow, to digitize supply chains in emerging markets. This protects brands and consumers from counterfeits and boosts supply chain operational efficiency by 30x, connecting all stakeholders from manufacturing through distribution, retail, and the last mile.",

That’s exactly why we created Frimake.\n\nWith Frimake, people meet new faces every day through real-life activities.\n\nOne click is all it takes to join a plan created by another member like you, and just like that, you’re reconnecting with life and rebuilding social bonds that time or circumstances may have broken.\n\nBut what if social impact also meant economic and environmental impact?\n\nFrimake took on that challenge... and won.\n\nWhen Frimakers meet up for drinks or a dinner night, they step out of their homes and spend money in local venues.\n\nThat means more traffic and revenue for local businesses, a much-needed boost in a post-pandemic world.\n\nFrimake, recently awarded Social Enterprise of the Year, became the 4th most downloaded app in France, right behind Meta group.",

Unlike traditional GPS-based solutions, HawkVision uses real-time sensing and machine learning to detect obstacles in the vehicle’s path and alert drivers in time to avoid impact. Our solution is first offered as an aftermarket unit for fleet operators and will evolve into an OEM-integrated system capable of interacting with onboard vehicle systems, including autonomous emergency braking.

The innovations provided by the start-ups must have a positive impact for their customers and users either on income, nutrition, adaptation to climate change or circular economy. SAIS is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

Traditional banks are designed for workers who earn the same amount, on the same day, each month - leaving the majority of workers underbanked, without access to lending, investments or tailored budgeting tools.\n\nAt Kasi Money, we’re building banking from the ground up to cater for unpredictable income, and not punish it. We’re helping gig & unsalaried workers to better manage, leverage and grow their income.\n\nAnyone can sign up for an account within 5 minutes with just their ID, passport or asylum documents. Customers get a virtual or physical debit card to tap, swipe and transact both online and in-person, as well as withraw from any ATM. \n\nWe also offer tailored financial tools such as interest-free cash advances, investments that automatically put away a % of each paycheck and insights to better manage your money.",

    "description": "In sub-Saharan Africa, the demand for affordable and reliable breathing assistance devices is critical. Due to the high costs of acquisition and transport from Europe and North America, many medical centers lack access to these essential devices. As a result, patients in respiratory distress are often treated with direct oxygen support or manually ventilated using an Ambu bag, both of which have limitations. Oxygen support is only effective for those with normal lung function, while manual ventilation is labor-intensive, requiring round-the-clock human effort - resources that are often unavailable. These challenges contribute to high mortality rates for respiratory distress patients in underserved communities. Hence, our mission is to design and manufacture portable, affordable respiratory devices tailored to the unique needs of sub-Saharan Africa. By providing alternative power supplies and ensuring cost-effectiveness, we aim to save lives and transform healthcare in the region.",

    "description": "Our mission is simple: Catch tomorrow's disease in today's data, addressing the annual loss of millions of lives due to late diagnostics. \n\nWe detect diseases before symptoms appear by uncovering hidden patterns across fragmented medical histories. We address three critical healthcare barriers: the impracticality of universal screening, the siloed nature of specialist care, and the messy state of medical data.\n\nThrough federated learning and meta-learning, we analyse medical data where it lives - without ever moving it - and extract meaningful insights from inherently chaotic electronic health records.\n\nOur solution processes various medical data types (scans, blood tests etc) and turns fragmented information into unified diagnostics.\n\nBy enabling precise risk stratification of the general population, we shift healthcare from reactive to proactive, preventing costly hospital stays, and empowering doctors to diagnose more people, more accurately and faster.

In Egypt & much of Africa, widespread testing only became available by late 2020 due to a lack of locally developed molecular diagnostics. This dependency on imported kits complicates availability, aligning it with international demand & foreign currency needs, while costs are inflated by shipping/import duties. More importantly, the imported kits are unsuitable for low-resource settings due to refrigeration requirements, making them unstable in hot climates.\nUtilizing our expertise in nanotechnology & biotechnology, we have developed a patented technology that overcomes these limitations. Reme-D's tests that are stable at room temperature, easier to use & 6 times more affordable than competitors. Since our inception, we have launched over 30 testing products, including those for Hepatitis C/B, HIV, Tuberculosis,& Human Papillomavirus, selling nearly 300,000 tests across four countries.",
